ðŸ‘‹ About Me

A BCA graduate with a passion for ethical hacking and cybersecurity,
currently exploring penetration testing and red team operations. 
I thrive on identifying vulnerabilities and contributing to robust
security frameworks.

Alongside cybersecurity, I have dabbled in data science (AI/ML), 
web development (React.js, Node.js), and blockchain technologies.
I hold certifications from IIT Delhi and IIT Kanpur and have gained 
practical experience as a cybersecurity intern at Employment Express Verband LLP.

Iâ€™ve participated in and achieved distinctions in several competitions, 
including Hackathon 2K24 and MUN 2K22. Always eager to learn, 
I strive to grow through collaborative projects and open-source 
contributions.
